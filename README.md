## Notes
**Player & Player Items**
- The player can move, but not run, attack, sneak, or lean behind an obstacle to shoot. Needs to be implemented.
- Player stats are incomplete. Needs to be implemented.
- Items that the player can use/pick up are added to the level, but not scripted. Needs to be implemented.

**Enemies**
- Enemies are within a trigger area that allows them to move when a player enters, feel free to duplicate the patrol area or change the emenies within it.
- No need to modify anything about the enemies within Unity, unless you want to change the points of interest (POI) they will go to. Just delete or duplicate when needed.
- Enemy POI are grouped in sets of 3 in the hierarchy, add more or less as desired and reference them to the enemy of choice.
- Enemy will follow player if the player is within their FOV, but not call other enemies to follow or attack. Needs to be implemented.
- Enemies have a field of view (FOV) which get blocked accordingly by the obsticles.

**Obstacles**
- All objects inside "Obstacles" are set to a specific layer, don't take them out.
- Duplicate objects when needed, and disable them if you want to remove them

**Gameplay Loop**
- Not yet implemented. Please do so if you can.

**Animations**
- None of the entities have animations yet, Mixamo wouldn't apply animations to models with non-Mixamo skeletons/rigs.
- To fix this, open the models in Blender or smth and delete the rig. Export as .obj to open them in Mixamo.

**Textures**
- The models have textures now, thanks Niv
